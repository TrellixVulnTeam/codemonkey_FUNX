I will do it **again**. Writing a blog and the motivation for me this time is to document mostly the work on my "write a database" project.

<!--more-->

I tried it many times, the blog more often than the database thing but both failed. The first try on the [database project](https://github.com/sebfischer83/datatent) was too ambitious. Too many features, too complex.

The blog writing has similar problems, I want to write perfect articles but that doesn't work that way.

This time it's different! (?)
